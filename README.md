# Cart-Abandonment-Analysis

## Introduction
Cart abandonment is a common challenge faced by e-commerce businesses worldwide. This portfolio project focuses on analyzing cart abandonment patterns using SQL-based data analysis techniques. By leveraging key datasets such as user behavior, product data, session information, and transaction details, this case study aims to provide insights into why users add items to their carts but fail to complete their purchases. Understanding these behaviors can help businesses improve customer experience, optimize their sales funnel, and increase overall revenue.

## Business Problem
E-commerce businesses often encounter a high rate of shopping cart abandonment, where customers leave the website without completing their purchase despite showing interest by adding products to their cart. This represents a lost opportunity for revenue. Understanding the root causes behind cart abandonment can help identify gaps in the user experience, such as complex checkout processes, unexpected fees, or other barriers that prevent customers from completing their transactions. Addressing this issue is critical for maximizing conversion rates and reducing lost sales.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to perform a thorough analysis of cart abandonment data to identify:

- The cart abandonment rate and the frequency of abandonment.

- Products most frequently abandoned.

- User behaviors and characteristics that lead to cart abandonment.

- Patterns in transactions and abandoned carts that could provide actionable insights.

- Key reasons for cart abandonment and their correlation with user sessions and product categories.

The ultimate objective is to recommend strategies to reduce cart abandonment and enhance conversion rates, contributing to improved customer satisfaction and revenue growth.
